# Python Lemmy API Wrapper
Like PRAW but for Lemmy

I'm throwing this together so I can develop the Sports Bot [redball](https://github.com/benja810/redball), which depends on praw. I am not a python developer and just hacked this together. Only the methods I needed were made and I didn't make any models or helpers like praw has.

I used the official [Lemmy TS library](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client) for reference.

I will expand this as I need in order to develop the Lemmy bot for redball.
